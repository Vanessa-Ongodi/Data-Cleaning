Dirty data can create problems in data analysis and has to be taken care of before proceeding to the next phase. This data consists of incorrect information. 

Sometimes in large datasets, completely removing dirty data from a source can be impossible so we aim to clean at least 80–90% of the data. To make good data predictions and create better visualizations with data, the raw data acquired must be cleaned because unclean data can impact data findings.


 Data cleaning is a part of the data preprocessing stage.
