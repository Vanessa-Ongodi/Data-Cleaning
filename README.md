# Data-Cleaning

Dirty data can create problems in data analysis and has to be taken care of before proceeding to the next phase of handling data. This data consists of incorrect
information. Sometimes in large datasets, completely removing dirty data from a source can be impossible. To make good data predictions and create better 
visualizations with data, the raw data acquired must be cleaned. Unclean data can impact data results data science and data analysis. 
Data cleaning is a part of the data preprocessing stage.
